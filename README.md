# PDDL to SMV translators

This is a collection of translator from pddl format to smv format. They are all based on Fabio Patrizi first version to translate pddl files to [TLV](https://cs.nyu.edu/acsys/tlv/) files.

It is done using the [Bison](https://www.gnu.org/software/bison/) parser and FLEX. Both distribution used are included here (as new versions may not work).

Currently there are transltors to SMV files for TLV, JTLV and NuGAT game solver formats.

These translators were used for experimentation in the following article:
