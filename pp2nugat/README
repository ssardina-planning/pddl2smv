Adapted for NuGAT - Sebastian Sardina - ssardina@gmail.com - March 2015

Basically:

- added the bottom part for the GAME section, 
- removed the Main module
- completed a few case .. easc constructs with TRUE : TRUE;
(all marked with "Seb" as comment)
- used FALSE for boolean instead of 0 (it does not work anymore with 0 in the SMV 2.5.4)

COMPILATION TIPS:

To generate the parser, you need Bison 2.4. 
However, if you do not plan to change the parser, you can use the one provided with this release.

As for the scanner, the program was compiled using Flex 2.5.35, though other versions might work as well

All tools necessary for compilation are included tools/ (except of course, the c++ compiler ;-) )

"make all" should work. Good Luck.
