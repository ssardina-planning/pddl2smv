THis is a collection of translator from pddl format to smv format

The first one is Fabio's pddl2smv. It is the base and relies on particular version of flex+bison which are under tool.

From that one, we have then different translators to TLV, JTLV and NUGAT.

In principle, one would like ONE single translator with options --nugat --tlv etc...
