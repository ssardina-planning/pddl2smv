# PDD to SMV translators

This is a collection of translator from pddl format to smv format. They are all based on Fabio Patrizi first version to translate pddl files to [TLV](https://cs.nyu.edu/acsys/tlv/) files.

It is done using the [Bison](https://www.gnu.org/software/bison/) parser and FLEX. Both distribution used are included here (as new versions may not work).

Currently there are transltors to SMV files for TLV, JTLV and NuGAT.

### TODO

In principle, one would like ONE single translator with options `--nugat`, `--tlv`, and so on.
